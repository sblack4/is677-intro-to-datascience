conv_base <- application_vgg16(  
  weights = "imagenet",  
  include_top = TRUE
)

conv_base
```

3.	Create a keras model to extract the output feature maps of the first eight layers, conv and maxpooling combined. (20 points)


4.	Run the keras model you created for the last question. (20 points)


5.	Create a function to plot the channels (filters). (20 points)
